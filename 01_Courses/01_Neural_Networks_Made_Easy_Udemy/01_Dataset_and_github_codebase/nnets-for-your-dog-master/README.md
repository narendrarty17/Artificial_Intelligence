# Neural Networks For Your Dog
A beginner's course to learning artificial neural networks. This course explains them so well your dog could learn them ;)

This repository contains some supporting code and data used throughout the course, but the course itself is a series of video 
lectures hosted [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9oKUrtC4VP5N3VtTTjhTfiHoFXmnrgPW). 
Alternatively, you can watch the course [on my blog](https://www.gormanalysis.com/blog/neural-networks-for-your-dog/).
